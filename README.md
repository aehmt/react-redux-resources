### React Review
[Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) from FB     
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) Helpful when starting a new project
### Redux
[A Cartoon Introduction to Redux](https://code-cartoons.com/a-cartoon-intro-to-redux-3afb775501a6#.5m2e47a72) Great higher level overview        
[Redux Documentation](http://redux.js.org/index.html) Redux has exceptionally great documentation. Read it!     
[Udemy React-Redux Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) This does cost money (as of 10/25 on sale for $19) but comes *highly* recommended.       ![somehting you'll build in the udemy course](images/udemy.png)     
[Egghead redux videos](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)  videos lovingly narrated by Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux. We would recommend actually building out the projects he demonstrates.  Build a simple todo list app and then make many refactors of it. He'll have you build out an implementation of the Redux store on your own, which is really helpful to solidify your understanding.      ![somehting you'll build in the egghead course](images/egghead.png)     
[React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-tutorial)  Introduction to React Router

### Wow, there's even some labs
*None of these labs currently have any tests. Follow the guidelines to achieve the desired functionality. *     

[Fredux Todo](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/fredux-todo-list) An implementation of the redux store is set up for you. Use it to complete this lab.     
[Boozr API](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/boozer-api-web-0716) This is a  Rails app that you will clone down and use as an API in the next lab. You'll have to add some things to get it working.
